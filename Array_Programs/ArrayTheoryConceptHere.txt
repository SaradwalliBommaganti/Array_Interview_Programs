📘 Array Notes for Interview Preparation

🔹 What is an Array?

📌 An array is a collection of similar data types.

📌 It stores multiple values in a single variable.

📌 Arrays are homogeneous (all elements have the same type).

📌 Indexing starts from 0.

📌 Useful when working with a fixed number of elements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔹 Key Features of Arrays

📌 Fixed Size – Size must be defined when creating the array.

📌 Indexed Access – Each element is accessed using an index.

📌 Contiguous Memory – Elements are stored in continuous memory locations.

📌 Fast Retrieval – Accessing by index is fast (O(1) time).

📌 Costly Insertion/Deletion – Requires shifting elements.

🔹 Types of Arrays

🧭 Based on Dimensions:

✅ 1D Array (One-Dimensional) – Linear array.

➤ Example: int[] arr = {10, 20, 30};

✅ 2D Array (Two-Dimensional) – Like a matrix (rows × columns).

➤ Example: int[][] matrix = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🧭 Based on Data Type:

✅ Primitive Array – Arrays of int, float, char, etc.

✅ Non-Primitive Array – Arrays of objects like String, custom class.

➤ Example: String[] names = {"Ram", "Shyam"};
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔹 Advantages of Arrays

⚡ Easy to use and understand.

⚡ Fast access to elements using index.

⚡ Useful for searching and sorting data.

⚡ Efficient for storing a fixed number of items.

🔹 Disadvantages of Arrays

❌ Size is fixed and cannot be resized.

❌ No built-in methods to add or remove elements.

❌ Insertion/deletion is not efficient (manual shifting needed).

❌ Wastes memory if not fully used.
