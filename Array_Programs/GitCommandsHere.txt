🔹 What is git clone?

git clone is a command used to make a copy of a Git repository from a remote source (like GitHub) to your local computer.

🧩 Think of it like this:

Imagine a project (code, files, etc.) is stored on GitHub — when you run git clone, you're downloading that entire project (along with its Git history) to your own machine so you can work on it.

🛠️ Basic Syntax:

git clone <repository-url>

📌 Example:

git clone https://github.com/username/project.

🌿 What is a Git Branch?

A Git branch is like a separate line of development in your project.

It lets you work on features, fixes, or experiments without affecting the main code.

📦 Why use branches?

To work on new features without breaking the main code.

To fix bugs separately.

To experiment safely.

🛠️ Common Git Branch Commands:

👉 Check current branch: ---> git branch

👉 Create a new branch: --->git branch my-feature

👉 Switch to a branch: --->git checkout my-feature

👉 Create and switch in one command: -->git checkout -b my-feature

👉 Merge a branch into main:
First, switch to main:

-->git checkout main

Then merge: ---> git merge my-feature

Delete a branch (after merge): --->git branch -d my-feature

📌 Git Workflow: git add, git commit, and git push

When working with Git, you typically follow this 3-step process to save and upload your 

changes to a remote repository like GitHub.

git add

👉 git add <filename>      # Add a specific file


👉 git add .               # Add all modified and new files in the current directory

-> This command adds your changes to the staging area.

-> It tells Git what you want to commit.

-> Nothing is saved permanently yet — it’s just marked for the next commit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

git commit

👉 git commit -m "Your commit message"

-> This saves a snapshot of the staged changes.

-> The -m flag allows you to include a short message describing what you changed.

-> Think of this as saving your work with a label.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git push

👉 git push origin (main or your branch name)

-> This sends your committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub.

-> origin is the default name for the remote.

-> main is the branch name (replace with master or other branch if needed).

 📌 Full Example Workflow:-

git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin main
